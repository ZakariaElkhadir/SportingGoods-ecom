# Project: Al's Sporting Goods - Mockup Translation

This project aims to translate the Figma mockup [Al's Sporting Goods](https://www.figma.com/proto/XeQSavUEAoDoszebXRXAqo/Al's-Sporting-Goods?node-id=1-2\&scaling=scale-down-width\&content-scaling=fixed) into a fully functional web application using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. We also plan to integrate a backend in the future to enhance functionality.

## Overview

This project is a collaborative effort to recreate the design and functionality of the provided mockup in React and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to ensure a responsive, reusable, and scalable component-based structure, which will simplify future backend integration.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI components and managing application state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
- **Figma**: Used as a design reference.
- **Future Backend**: (Optional) Node.js/Express or another framework for handling backend logic and database interactions.

## How We Work

### Collaboration

- The project is divided into components. Each team member is responsible for specific components.
- Tasks are assigned and tracked using a task management tool (Trello).

### Workflow

1. Review the mockup and divide the design into logical components.
2. Assign components to each team member.
3. Build and test each component individually before integrating.
4. Use Git for version control, creating branches for new features or fixes.
5. Merge changes to the main branch after review and approval.

### Styling Guidelines

- Follow the design system in the Figma mockup.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:``3000`.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Add an API to handle data (e.g., product listings, user accounts).
   - Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL).
2. **Authentication**:
   - Add user registration and login functionality.
3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement a shopping cart.
   - Add search and filtering capabilities.
